## Reason of Creating this application

Our program can be useful to restaurants that currently lack use of technology, to improve efficiency and speed.  Maybe one day our program can be used in some restaurant because we are creating a good, valuable program, not just a program for kids. By the way, we have applied our knowledge learned in class to this program such as many patterns and techniques that can be used in the program, and we also learn about how beautiful the code is when it is designed.


## Patterns: 

There are some design and technology used.
- MVC (Model View Controller) pattern will be used in this program. 
- Observer pattern used in display ordered items and more.
